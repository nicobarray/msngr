# Msngr

_A safe, privacy-first messaging webapp._

# Goal

- To start a conversation, share a link with someone, anywhere. The is valid for one person only (ask for a one time password ?). No user information is saved on the server.
- Share public-key to encrypt e2e messages.
- Chat history is not preserved after 1 hour.
- Pin specific message to a local vault storage only accessible and readable by the current user.
- Nice UI/UX ðŸŽ¨
